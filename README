For a quick demo, run:
$ make test-demo HEADER=test_api/test_api.h

Otherwise, run:
$ make interpose-src HEADER='api_header.h'

...which will create a few files based on the header filename; in this case:
   interpose_lib_api_header.cpp
   interpose_usr_api_header.cpp

The 'usr' C++ file should be all you have to modify for deciding what to do
with each intercepted call.

After you're done modifying the 'usr' file, run:
$ make interpose-lib HEADER='api_header.h'

If no compilation errors occurred, then an interposing library should have been
built. To use it with an application that uses the intercepted API, run:
$ make do-interpose HEADER='api_header.h' APP='api_test_app'
